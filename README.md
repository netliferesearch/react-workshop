# React workshop

## Project bootstrapping
Since React is not a comple framework, but rather an important piece of a bigger puzzle, setting up a project requires a bit of "bootstrapping". This can be a little overwhelming at first...

### Pieces of the puzzle
* Webpack (bundler/build tool)
* Babel (transpiler/compiler)
* EsLint (code standard checker)

### React
* ReactDOM
* Routes
